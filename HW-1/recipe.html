    <h2>User Comments</h2>
    <h3>Juliana:</h3>
    <p class="textcolor-white fontsize-09">I have to say, I'm amazed. I've had these ingredients just sitting around for
      months and until now I've never
      known a use for them! I made this sandwich a few days ago, but I am wondering
      what I should do about the blisters on my hands due to the gloves. There were no instruction to take them
      off afterwards so I've been spending my days wearing them, and it's becoming a
      little concerning. I am also still a little confused as to why my brother didn't enjoy the sandwich, as it
      was not an optional instruction, after telling him this he reminded me (rudely) that he has
      a peanut allergy. Is it true that this would stop him from enjoying it? Anyway, I've been in the hospital
      with him for a while now and I'm wondering if that instruction still applies? Should I show
      him the article? Do you think that would make a difference? I did bring the sandwich with me in case, thanks
      in advance! It also doesn't specify how the jelly should be applied, so I used my
      better judgment and used my hand. Overall, I'd love if you went into more detail next time, maybe a few
      hundred steps to be sure</p>
